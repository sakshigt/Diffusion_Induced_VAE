# Diffusion_Induced_VAE
This project leverages a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to analyze the MNIST dataset, encoding handwritten digits into a structured latent space for efficient representation and reconstruction. It involves training the model with combined loss optimization and evaluating performance through latent space visualizations and reconstruction quality.
